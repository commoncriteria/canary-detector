CANary DEtector (aka cande, /can-dee/)
======================================

## About This Project
Cande is a prototype that demonstrates how one might detect stack-canaries in non-obfuscated files that are of type Portable Executable (PE) or Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).
Cande detects stack canaries (or cookies) as created by GCC, clang, or the Microsoft Visual Studio compilers.
Including stack protections in an application is a requirement in the Protection Profile for Application Software (https://www.niap-ccevs.org/pp/pp_app_v1.2.htm#FPT_AEX_EXT.1.5).
